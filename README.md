# Employee Attrition Prediction Using AI

This AI project predicts whether an employee is at risk of leaving the organization based on HR and workplace-related features. Using a stacking ensemble model (Random Forest + XGBoost + Logistic Regression), it provides high-accuracy predictions along with insights for HR analytics.
